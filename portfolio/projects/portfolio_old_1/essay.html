		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever since I was given my first computer when I was 13, I knew I was going to have a future career in computing.  Technology to me is not the latest gadget or a status symbol, but an everyday part of our lives, something that has become so prevalent that it often integrates itself seamlessly with our surroundings.  I went to college to study Computer Science because I wanted to create technology and products for people; and during the past two years at CU, I have really developed specific interests in computing.  I’m fascinated by the way people interact with technology and have focused my studies to center around a future career where I can design and implement user friendly technology.  My area of focus in Computer Science is Human-Centered Computing, an area where I strive to have a related career in also.  Computers, cell phones, and the internet are not fads, but established and constant pieces of technology whose influence will only continue to grow and expand.  People do not need or want static and outdated technology.  Human-centered computing is something that will become necessary and as I develop a career in the field, the TAM program is a way I can achieve this specialty.
		<br/><br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The School of Engineering has taught me a lot when it comes to the logic and structuring of programs; however, one cannot create entire pieces of technology with only C code.  Much technology developed today comes in contact with users and must be developed with them in mind.  The TAM program will offer me a way to learn the creative side of computing and expand my knowledge about the field as a whole.  Having a technical background is something I am proud of and know it will benefit me in the future.  I am able to solve problems from an engineering point of view and see situations in different a way than someone with a creative background.  However, I feel computer science has left holes where the computing and creative sides of technology merge, and the TAM program is the way I plan to fill these gaps.  Visual design is something that isn’t as valued in a technical field; however, it is essential to any piece of technology that someone comes in contact with.  Users don’t want to type commands into a prompt (unless their UNIX users).  People like things created for them.  People want to interact with technology.  People like color.  This is everything I see the TAM program offering me that computer science doesn’t.  When I graduate I want a rounded educational background and if I have a chance to study in a program and learn relevant skills that I can use in college or in a career, I wouldn’t want to miss that opportunity.  I would like to study in the TAM program to further my career, my studies, and myself.
