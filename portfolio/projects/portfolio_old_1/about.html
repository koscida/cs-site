		My name is Brittany Kos and I’m a junior in Computer Science at the University of Colorado at Boulder.  
		I plan to graduate in December of 2012 with my Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science and a minor 
		in Technology, Arts, and Media. 
	</div>
	
	<div id="par2">
		 I have always been interested in design and color as well as problem solving and engineering.  
		 (It became a problem when I wanted to go to art school and my mom would only support engineering).  
		 As I have grown up, it has always been this constant battle between the left and right halves of 
		 my brain fighting for dominance.  I ultimately chose to study computer science engineering, but 
		 with a human-centered computing emphasis.  I eventually want to design and build systems for people 
		 to use on any technological platform.
	</div>
	<div id="par3">
		Lately I have been getting into more design and layout of systems and have been working heavily 
		with websites.  I started teaching myself html and css a few months ago, so my projects are still 
		at a beginner’s stage, but I plan to expand on what I have learned and continue working with web 
		technology.
