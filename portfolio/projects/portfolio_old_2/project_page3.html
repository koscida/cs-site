			<p>This was a project I worked on in <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/courses/geen1400.html" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;">
			GEEN 1400: Freshmen Projects</a>.  I worked in a group 
			with 9 other students creating an oversized mailbox that utalized a touchscreen tablet
			for kids ages 4-7 to take and send pictures with.  I was the lead programmer on the 
			project and was responsible for creating the GUI as well.</p>
			
			<p>Simplicity and visuals drove my design for the interface, which was especially key 
			since I was creating a product that was going to be used by an audience with very 
			limited reading capibilities.  We did user testing with a small group of children 
			which was incredibly informative to our design.</p>
			
			<p>I built the project using <a href="http://www.ni.com/labview/" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;">
			labview</a>, which was a 
			challenging yet fun experience because I had to teach myself everything and learn to work 
			around the limits of the language. The project was submitted at the 
			<a href="http://itll.colorado.edu/index.php/design_expo" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;">Engineering Design Expo</a> 
			and won Best in Group and Runner-up for 
			<a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/department/news/spring2009expo.html" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;">User's Choice 
			Award</a>.</p>
