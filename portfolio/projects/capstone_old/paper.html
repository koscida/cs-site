					<legend>Requirements</legend>
					<p>Write a research paper on a person, group of people, organization or company who is exploring 
					the intersection of Technology, Arts, and Media and your major field of study
					&bull; Your paper should be between 4-5 pages in length (Double-spaced)
					&bull; Your paper must include at least 3 cited sources listed within a bibliography
					&bull; Citations must be from legitimate sources which include published books, documentary 
					media, journals, interviews, primary source websites, etc.
					&bull; Wikipedia, Google, and third party blogs are not legitimate sources and should only be 
					used to help you find more factual resources for you paper
					&bull; This paper is due posted to your portal in .doc format
					&bull; While not required, rough drafts and outlines turned in by WED NOV 2nd will be reviewed 
					by the instructor for comments and feedback
					&bull; Because of the open-ended topic and the major-specific nature of this paper, it is 
					recommended that you establish your subject matter early on. The Capstone instructor might be 
					able to help to find a topic, but you are more knowledgeable about your own major and thus you, 
					and perhaps your major professors, will be better able to come up with a topic relative to the 
					assignment</p>
