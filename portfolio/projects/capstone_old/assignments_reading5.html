				<h1>Reading 5</h1> <h3>Internet Art &ndash; Chapter 4</h3>
				<br/>
				
				<p>I thought Adrian Miles's VLOG site very similar in what some YouTubers are trying to do with the site 
				now.  I thought it was interesting that the term Vlog was around as far back as 2002, back when few people 
				even had an idea of what blogging was.  Though the videos I see today are nowhere near Miles's vision of 
				linked desktops and layered videos, I see vloggers trying to create more interactive videos every year.  
				Though this might seem like a step back from Miles's vision, YouTube is mass producing a small portion 
				of Miles's vision and making it freely available to anyone, not just someone with the software/hardware 
				to produce these videos.</p>

					<p>The art pieces within this final chapter focus on works reliant on digital networks in order to be 
					conveyed properly within the vision of the artist. While many of these pieces are several years old and 
					either utilized custom networks or now deprecated networks, with the recent emergence of web 2.0 
					technologies, the delivery methods for such projects have only expanded. Choose a specific example from 
					chapter 4 and discuss how this piece could be re-implemented within today's web 2.0 environment and still 
					convey the same topic or theme as was originally intended. How would the project change (for better or 
					for worse) existing within a new networked environment?</p>
