				<h1>Reading 3</h1> <h3>Internet Art &ndash; Chapter 2</h3>
				<br/>
				
				<p>I think the idea of digital art intriguing, but having the internet as a display space could be better.  
				To me, I think the internet is ever changing and nothing is solid or stable.  Everything is rapidly changing, 
				so internet art has the possibility of becoming obsolete or outdated.  I was looking at some of the 
				examples from this book and the very early internet art pieces seem really simple.  I know of some websites 
				that have more complexity than the art examples listed in the book.  I think art is something that can be 
				non&ndash;static and can incorporate changing pieces, but it should not be treated as traditional art becasue 
				eventually it will have an expiration date.</p>

					<p>From cave paintings to epic cathedral art to modern internet art, the medium through which artwork 
					is displayed is one of the major factors in that artworks ability to speak out and convey its message, 
					theme, or idea. As you read chapter 2, consider the medium of the internet and how artwork displayed 
					on the web is treated, viewed, and expressed. Within 100-150 words, discuss the internet as a medium 
					for artistic expression and display as well as both the benefits it offers and the disadvantages it 
					may have. Compair internet art vs. traditional art found in museums.</p>
