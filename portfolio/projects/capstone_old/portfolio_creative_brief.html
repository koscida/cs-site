				<h1>Portfolio</h1><h3>Creative Brief and Look and Feel</h3>
				<p>When looking for designs for my portfolio, I wanted it to be visually unified so my projects would stand 
				out.  I wanted to either choose a black or white site, without too much color.  When I started initially 
				designing the site, I realized that I was copying two sites I visit often, 
				<a href="http://imgur.com">imgur.com</a> and <a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com/">colorschemedesigner.com</a>. </p>
				<p>I really like the way these two sites visually display information.   Both go with a basic black/dark gray color 
				scheme, so anything colorful that the sites display will stand out.  They are both are designed to display pictures 
				and images, which will be everything my portfolio will display.</p>
				<p>Color Scheme Designer is a flash based site, which is not the direction I wanted to go, but I really like the 
				navigation and shifting between pages, this is something I would like to copy within my site, but through implementing 
				ajax pages and changing pages by using jquery. </p>
				<p>I also really like Imgur's side navigation.  Thee is some basic navigation at the top of the page, but this is 
				minimal and the previews for the next images are on the side.  I have horizontal navigation on every other webpage I've 
				made, so by switching this will be a nice change of pace.  I also like the accent of green and blue they have, a totally black 
				and grey page will be boring, so color interest will be nice.  I still have to mess with the color scheme I would go 
				with, but I like the green or red I have on my initial design.</p>
