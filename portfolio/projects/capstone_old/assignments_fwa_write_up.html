				<h1>FWA Write-Up</h1> <h3>Greenpeace &ndash; A New Warrior</h3>
				<br/>
				
				<p>I like the concept here and what they are trying to do with interactive designs.  
				When displaying 3D modeling, there are very few programs out there that one can see 
				the interior of a ship and the public has access to.  Putting this on a website makes 
				a bit slower, but the resolution available is amazing. </p>
				
				<p>The navigation was a bit confusing, and I found there to be inconsistencies when I 
				clicked or hovered over things.  After I first clicked on the ship, I though additional 
				clicks would take me to other pages, but they didn't.  I also had to look for the 
				navigation and how to get back to where I started, which was confusing.  When one clicks 
				to the ship decks, there is dual animation for the deck and the navigation, I lost track 
				of the navigation and couldn't find it.  It is also on the deck picture, blending with 
				the background.</p>
				
				<p>However, this was an excellent trade off because the oversized deck displays are great 
				for viewing.  Once one becomes used to navigating this new design, it becomes simple 
				and very each to use.  Overall, a great way is displaying ship information.</p>

					<p>Review all of the sites presented in the FWA - 2011 Site of the Month and write a brief response to the site (or sites) which you feel are the most groundbreaking on this list.
					&bull; Consider style, design, concept, message, navigation and usability when writing your response.
					&bull; Your response should be between 150 and 200 words in length.</p>
