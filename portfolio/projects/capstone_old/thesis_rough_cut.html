				<h1>Thesis Project</h1> <h3>Rough Cut</h3>
				<br/>
				<p>Right now I have three (four) pages built for my project.  I'm thinking of heading into a 
				CSS Zen garden direction, with a common webpage and applying different css to each of the pages for
				different websites.  I'm goin to do Google, Facebook, YouTube, Yahoo, MSN, Blogger, Twitter, 
				Wikipedia, and Windows Live.  They each took a little longer to dsplay than I anticipated, so I only
				have three pages done now, but will complete more.  </p>
				<p>I'm still unsure about how I want to display each page, I want to have the complete page display
				becasue I want the full effect of the page, but it makes displaying them difficult.  I've been looking
				into creating a greater webpage with a slide show of each of the pages, and a user will click to open
				a lightbox with each page in it.  The slide show at the beginning will have a description of the page
				and a grid layout for the page, or a breakdown of the styling.</p>
				<p>I'm still playing around with the idea of creating the 'best' webpage, with all of the elements 
				averaged out, but maybe creating a 'build your webpage' option, where someone could input their own 
				text and content for each of the sections and pick which styling from each page they want.</p>

					<p>&bull; Continue building your thesis project 
					and begin moving towards a rough cut &bull; Your rough cut should be a working draft of your project 
					but may still need moderate amounts of content, details, and structure before being considered 
					completed &bull; Your rough cut is not to be interpreted as a final completed piece &bull; Rough 
					cuts of your projects will be critiqued by your peers and the instructor &bull; Be prepared to 
					present on the rough cut due date</p>
