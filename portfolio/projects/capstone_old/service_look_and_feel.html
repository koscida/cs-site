				<h1>Campus Service Project</h1> <h3>Creative Brief and Concept Studies</h3>
				<br/>
				
				<p>The USCSA Ski Team at CU Boulder enjoys strong, dedicated leadership
				under its longtime director, Paul Rozsypal. However, the team lacks a cohesive,
				broad branding strategy that links together the many elements that compose the
				program. The team is not supported financially by CU; thus, its source of income is
				fees charged of the members of the team. Recruiting new members and retaining
				old members is essential to the survival of the USCSA team. As a brand selling
				itself to the student body, the team needs a unified, ubiquitous style of branding
				that identifies it to prospective racers. In this project, we will attempt to link many
				aspects of the team to one another by creating similar, recognizable elements across
				different forms of media.</p>

				<p>These forms of media include the team’s website, flyers around campus,
				business cards, and stickers. The website is maintained by a CU graduate in Japan
				and is somewhat of a legacy system from 2005. The site contains a lot of great
				information on the team and resources, but feels dated. We will build a
				supplementary, more stylish site geared towards students using mostly HTML and
				PHP. This site will be hosted off the Redwood server on an independent domain. The
				flyers we create in InDesign will be posted around campus advertising the
				recruiting meetings occurring throughout the fall. Our team has obtained the
				necessary requirements for flyers posted on CU boards regarding neon dyes, paper
				weight, etc. as well as the copyright rules surrounding the use of the CU logo and
				buffalo. The business cards will be fancy-looking, simplistic cards that Paul can hand
				to prospective recruits. They will likely show the logo we design and the web
				address in the same color scheme that we establish on the site and flyers. Finally,
				the stickers will be designed in the same fashion – flashy little advertisements for
				the ski team. The cards and stickers will be designed in Photoshop and InDesign.</p>
