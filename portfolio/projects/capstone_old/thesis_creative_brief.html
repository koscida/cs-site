				<h1>Thesis Project</h1> <h3>Creative Brief</h3>
				<br/>
				<p>I have always been extremely interested in interface design and usability.  In CS, Iâ€™m studying 
				Human-Centered-Computing and I have spent a lot of time researching what goes into good design.  
				It seems that there is an intuitive element that goes into good design that makes it feel like 
				someone has to be born with.  In my thesis project, I want to analyze different websites and really 
				study what goes into making them.  I want to see of there is a formula for good design.  </p>
				
				<p>I heard once that Google spend hundreds of thousands of dollars researching the exact color of blue 
				that their links should be when they gave search results, to optimize how often users would actually 
				click on them.  Facebook blue is almost instantly recognizable and besides black and white it the 
				only color the site uses.   Blue, it seams, is the color of the Internet and the choices websites as 
				large as Facebook and Google would not make these choices lightly.</p>
				
				<p>Site layout is something that is designers spend tons of time trying to perfect, so I wonder if 
				there is a sort of golden ratio to create the best website.  Is there a common padding and margin size 
				that makes text more readable?  Is horizontal navigation always the best?  Do sites have the same 
				functionality for active, hovering, or visited links?  Is there a standard, or does it depend on the 
				website?</p>
				
				<p>This project will be web-based and will be displayed with the other web-based thesis projects.   
				For the project, I plan to display each of these websites as a common user sees them and once they 
				click around of hover over parts, the div size, padding, margin will be displayed, showing the 
				behind-the-scenes of what goes into the website.  At the end of the demos, I would like to create 
				the average or common denominator website that employs the commonalities between all the sites I 
				displayed before.</p>
