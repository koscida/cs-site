				<h1>Reading 1</h1> <h3>Internet Art &ndash; Introduction</h3>
				<br/>
				
				<p>I don't think we have fully seen the potential of the internet yet.  I know this might 
				be cliche after the reading talking about the Internet, but I was reading this 
				<a href="http://xkcd.com/949/">web comic</a> and realized we have the opportunity to for 
				communication and information transfer to anyone in the world and we often just use the 
				internet to check email.  There are tools for communication out there, but a small 
				percentage uses them; instead I see groups emailing versioned documents back and forth, 
				in a bottle&ndash;necked, singular fashion.  I think torrenting is the closest we have come 
				to large scale data sharing and its only used to illegally download music and movies.  
				I realize people are still hindered by bandwidth speeds, but then, why are webpages only 
				build with text, rarely data feeds from massive files, so that information can be available?</p>
				
				<fieldset class="requirements">
					<legend>Requirements</legend>
					<p>Many of the innovations we see today that have come from the internet have been due to 
					people rethinking and reworking modern communications tools, programs, and devices.
					&ndash; For WED consider a modern means of communication and rethink its application 
					and how it can further benefit/affect our lives</p>
