		<p>According to Alexa.com, the top visited websites in America are Google, Facebook, YouTube, 
		Yahoo, Wikipedia, Twitter, and Amazon.  Each of these sites has millions 
		of hits daily and the color scheme and layout can be recognized instantly.  This project 
		focuses on the styling for these nine of the top America websites.  It duplicates the look 
		of each site and applies it to a common page.</p>
		
		<p>Each of these sites has development teams of hundreds or thousands of people working behind 
		the scenes, to create a unique user experience for its visitors.  The content being displayed 
		and the user’s needs drive the design for each site and are continually being updates.</p>
		
		<p>The idea behind the project is to apply the most recognizable styling techniques each of these 
		sites use to a standard webpage and see how well each site’s styling transfers.  In this 
		interactive project, a user, one can apply an entire site’s styling to the webpage, or pick 
		and choose elements from each site.   This is supposed to be a thought experiment to explore 
		how well website design can be abstracted, adapted, and applied outside of its common usage.</p>
