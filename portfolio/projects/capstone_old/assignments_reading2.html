				<h1>Reading 2</h1> <h3>Internet Art &ndash; Chapter 1</h3>
				<br/>
				
				<p>I thought the idea of cyberfeminism was an interesting think to come out of the internet, as 
				a female in computer science, I get the sexual connotations technology and art can have.  However, 
				I might disagree with their message.  Yes, I understand the bold statement they are trying to 
				make and they definitely come off as in&ndash;your&ndash;face and resolute, which might have been necessary 
				for the time, and certainly the type of message I would expect from women in that age group, 
				but I'm not convinced if that was the best way to deal with cyber feminism.  The eroticization 
				of their message, I think, undermines it and does the opposite of their intent.  As a female who's 
				entire career will probable revolve around the internet, I do want to be treated equally in a 
				male&ndash;dominated field, and I do want my opinions to be treated the the same amount of respect 
				as a male colleague, however, calling myself the "future cunt" might not be the best way to approach 
				this problem.</p>

					<legend>Requirements</legend>
					<p>Many early examples of internet art exhibit the same prevailent themes and ideas which 
					still relate to viewers today. As you read chapter 1, visit some of these art projects 
					online and within 100-150 words, discuss one of the pieces which you feel relates to you 
					and how. Discuss theme and content within the piece and how those elements relate to your 
					life or how that project resonates within you.</p>
