				<h1>Program Summary</h1>
				<p>Since around 1950 the University of Colorado has not only had a NCAA Varsity Alpine Ski 
				Team, but also a secondary or Development team (as it used to be named). Although this 
				secondary program existed under some structure, it wasn't until the fall of 1999 that it 
				truly formed into a high-level ski racing experience for the students of this University.</p>
				<p>Perhaps the biggest change in '99 was incorporating this program into the USCSA (United 
				States Collegiate Ski Association). This step allowed the athletes to get a real feel for 
				team college competition as opposed to only racing individually at certain USSA and FIS 
				sanctioned events. Within these past 12 years, the program has grown from 14 athletes to 
				60+ for this upcoming season. We have won the USCSA Rocky Mountain Conference for 10 
				consecutive years and won the overall title at the 2003 and 2008 Western Regional 
				Championships. This season (2011-2012) Western Regionals will be held in Steamboat Springs, 
				CO Feb.23-25 2012.</p>

						All Levels and Abilities are welcome to race
					</div>
					<div class="body">
						This USCSA program is designed for competitors of all levels, ranging from 40 point 
						NorAm/FIS/USSA athletes to first time racers. We train together and race the USCSA 
						Rocky Mountain Conference Series races together; however, only 5 male and 5 female 
						athletes are chosen for the USCSA Regional Championship event.<br/>
						<br/>
						Many also compete in the USSA Smartwool Series and the FIS Colorado Ski Cup races; 
						some also participate at NorAms, FIS-U, Junior Olympic Championship events, and even 
						US Nationals. Our athletes race at every level. Anyone can race USCSA & USSA, but one 
						must qualify for FIS. Such FIS events are held all over the country.<br/>
						<br/>
						The USCSA program here at CU isnï¿½t aimed specifically as a stepping stone for the 
						NCAA Varsity team, but rather a stepping stone for building character, improving team 
						skills, friendships, physical fitness, mental focus, time management skills, and 
						attaining goals. There may be a select individual that does reach the Division I Varsity 
						level at CU if they are within the NCAA Eligibility guidelines and after a couple seasons 
						of consistent results and hard work, but this is not a practical aim for the group as 
						a whole.

						The training/racing intensity picks up after Christmas Break with four consecutive weekends of 
						Collegiate USCSA Conference races and Regionals as well as the individual USSA (United States

					</div>
					<div class="body">
						A van is provided daily for the athletes to take up to training and two vans, plus an equipment 
						vehicle heads to various races from our Ski Building headquarters based one mile east of campus. 
						Many athletes also car pool to and from training as well as many of the race venues.

						Academics
					</div>
					<div class="body">
						Athletes arrange their Spring Semester schedule accordingly. The morning training slot is always 
						8:30-10:30am. Although training is offered daily, not everyone can do so. Many athletes can only 
						train a few times a week, others more or less. Academics are highly prioritized. Each athlete must 
						retain at least a 2.0 GPA to be able to participate in USCSA. Many athletes manage their time well 
						and are able to successfully race and study. Engineering, Business, and Pre-Med are amongst the 
						many degrees on the team.

						Financial Commitment
					</div>
					<div class="body">
						The USCSA Ski Team at CU is not in joint cooperation with the NCAA Varsity program, which is part 
						of the Athletic Dept. or Club Sports; it stands as an Independent Organization at CU. Thus, there 
						is no financial support from the University.<br/>
						<br/>
						In order to be a part of this USCSA racing program, every competitor pays a $1,200 Team Fee which 
						is divided up in two ways. One check for $900 goes to the University of Colorado, which covers 
						coaching expenses (Head Coach/Assistant Coaches), and the General Administrative Recharge (GAR). 
						The remaining $300 is placed into the Colorado Ski Racing account, which goes towards: hill space, 
						van rentals, gates, wrenches, drills, cameras, radios, lodging deposits, race entry fee deposits, 
						Rocky Mountain Conference fees, bib deposits, etc.<br/>
						<br/>
						The athletes also buy their own equipment, which is offered to them through Pro Form race deals 
						(50% off) and stands alone from the Team Fee. Other means of attaining equipment besides Pro Form 
						is also provided.<br/>
						<br/>Athletes also need to purchase a USSA license (required) $150, FIS license (optional), an 
						Eldora season pass ($149), race entry fees ($25 per race day), discounted lift tickets at races 
						(approx. $30), hotels, and travel. Overall the season will run an average amount of $1,700 total, 
						not including equipment (optional). More race starts and lodging costs will also contribute to 
						the overall total.<br/>
						<br/>Ski racing has never been an inexpensive sport of choice, but we've all chosen it for a 
						wonderful reason! These fees are desirable when compared to any other full-time program offered in 
						the country. This team is the real deal. If you want to have an awesome high-level ski racing 
						experience or are in it just to ski everyday and have fun, then here you have it.

						Refund Policy
					</div>
					<div class="body">
						Each athlete is granted a trial period from the Introductory Meeting (first week of Sept.) to the 
						first Official Team Meeting (first Week of Oct.). During this time they can choose to pay the Team 
						Fee ($1,200) in full or wait till the Official Team Meeting.<br/>
						<br/>If an athlete chooses against the program during this trial period, but has already paid 
						his/her Team Fee in full, then a $250 cancellation fee will be assessed; $950 of the total Team 
						Fee will be reimbursed.<br/>
						<br/>If an athlete chooses against the program from the first Official Team Meeting (first Thursday 
						of Oct.) to November 30th (end of Dryland / pre-season training camp) then 50%; $600 of the total 
						Team Fee will be reimbursed.<br/>
						<br/>If an athlete chooses against the program after November 30th, there will be no available 
						reimbursement offered. An exception will be made for a season ending injury prior to the second 
						USCSA Rocky Mountain Conference Series race. This reimbursement will comprise of a 50% refund; 
						$600 of the total Team Fee.
