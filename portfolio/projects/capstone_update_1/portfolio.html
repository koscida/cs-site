				<h1>Creative Brief and Look and Feel</h1>
				
				<p>When looking for designs for my portfolio, I wanted it to be visually unified so my projects would stand 
				out.  I wanted to either choose a black or white site, without too much color.  When I started initially 
				designing the site, I realized that I was copying two sites I visit often, 
				<a href="http://imgur.com">imgur.com</a> and <a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com/">colorschemedesigner.com</a>. </p>
				
				<p>I really like the way these two sites visually display information.   Both go with a basic black/dark gray color 
				scheme, so anything colorful that the sites display will stand out.  They are both are designed to display pictures 
				and images, which will be everything my portfolio will display.</p>
				
				<p>Color Scheme Designer is a flash based site, which is not the direction I wanted to go, but I really like the 
				navigation and shifting between pages, this is something I would like to copy within my site, but through implementing 
				ajax pages and changing pages by using jquery. </p>
				
				<p>I also really like Imgur's side navigation.  There is some basic navigation at the top of the page, but this is 
				minimal and the previews for the next images are on the side.  I have horizontal navigation on every other webpage I've 
				made, so by switching this will be a nice change of pace.  I also like the accent of green and blue they have, a totally black and grey page will be boring, so color interest will be nice.  I still have to mess with the color scheme I would go 
				with, but I like the green or red I have on my initial design.</p>

				<h3>Requirements</h3>
				
				<p>Write a 100-150 word creative brief for your project.  Your creative brief should describe both your creative interpretation of the project as well as the technical approach you will use.</p>
				
				<p>Include 2-3 links to inspiring online portfolios which influence your direction. Create one or two images which demonstrate the potential layout and look-and-feel of your website.  These images will give you a foundation for the project and allow you to examine where elements such as navigation and content will be displayed within the site</p>

				<h3>Requirements</h3>
				
				<p>Considering your career aspirations and your intended path after graduating from CU, create a useful 
				digital portfolio website which will aid you in moving forward with your future career and/or studies.</p>
				
				<p>This project is tailored towards your post-graduate needs and should be developed specifically for 
				you.  This project should be professional in nature and may deal with any subject matter relevant to 
				your career and studies.</p>
				
				<p>You may choose to create your portfolio using any tools needed, but higher consideration will be 
				given to portfolios created by hand instead of through WYSIWYG applications.  There will be two turn-ins 
				of this project by the end of the semester but you should have your portfolio posted to your assignment 
				portal, ready for present on Monday.</p>
