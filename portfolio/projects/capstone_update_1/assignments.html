				<p>I like the concept here and what they are trying to do with interactive designs.  
				When displaying 3D modeling, there are very few programs out there that one can see 
				the interior of a ship and the public has access to.  Putting this on a website makes 
				a bit slower, but the resolution available is amazing. </p>
				
				<p>The navigation was a bit confusing, and I found there to be inconsistencies when I 
				clicked or hovered over things.  After I first clicked on the ship, I though additional 
				clicks would take me to other pages, but they didn't.  I also had to look for the 
				navigation and how to get back to where I started, which was confusing.  When one clicks 
				to the ship decks, there is dual animation for the deck and the navigation, I lost track 
				of the navigation and couldn't find it.  It is also on the deck picture, blending with 
				the background.</p>
				
				<p>However, this was an excellent trade off because the oversized deck displays are great 
				for viewing.  Once one becomes used to navigating this new design, it becomes simple 
				and very each to use.  Overall, a great way is displaying ship information.</p>

				<h1>Reading 1: Internet Art - Introduction</h1>
				<p>I don't think we have fully seen the potential of the internet yet.  I know this might 
				be cliche after the reading talking about the Internet, but I was reading this 
				<a href="http://xkcd.com/949/">web comic</a> and realized we have the opportunity to for 
				communication and information transfer to anyone in the world and we often just use the 
				internet to check email.  There are tools for communication out there, but a small 
				percentage uses them; instead I see groups emailing versioned documents back and forth, 
				in a bottle&ndash;necked, singular fashion.  I think torrenting is the closest we have come 
				to large scale data sharing and its only used to illegally download music and movies.  
				I realize people are still hindered by bandwidth speeds, but then, why are webpages only 
				build with text, rarely data feeds from massive files, so that information can be available?</p>

				</div>
				<h3>Requirements</h3>
				<p>Many of the innovations we see today that have come from the internet have been due to people 
				rethinking and reworking modern communications tools, programs, and devices.  For WED consider a 
				modern means of communication and rethink its application and how it can further benefit/affect 
				our lives</p>

				<h1>Reading 2: Internet Art Chapter 1</h1>
				<p>I thought the idea of cyberfeminism was an interesting think to come out of the internet, as 
				a female in computer science, I get the sexual connotations technology and art can have.  However, 
				I might disagree with their message.  Yes, I understand the bold statement they are trying to 
				make and they definitely come off as in-your-face and resolute, which might have been necessary 
				for the time, and certainly the type of message I would expect from women in that age group, 
				but I'm not convinced if that was the best way to deal with cyber feminism.  The eroticization 
				of their message, I think, undermines it and does the opposite of their intent.  As a female who's 
				entire career will probable revolve around the internet, I do want to be treated equally in a 
				male-dominated field, and I do want my opinions to be treated the the same amount of respect 
				as a male colleague, however, calling myself the "future cunt" might not be the best way to approach 
				this problem.</p>

				<h3>Requirements</h3>
				<p>Many early examples of internet art exhibit the same prevailent themes and ideas which 
				still relate to viewers today. As you read chapter 1, visit some of these art projects 
				online and within 100-150 words, discuss one of the pieces which you feel relates to you 
				and how. Discuss theme and content within the piece and how those elements relate to your 
				life or how that project resonates within you.</p>

				<h1>Reading 3: Internet Art - Chapter 2</h1>
				<p>I think the idea of digital art intriguing, but having the internet as a display space could be better.  
				To me, I think the internet is ever changing and nothing is solid or stable.  Everything is rapidly changing, 
				so internet art has the possibility of becoming obsolete or outdated.  I was looking at some of the 
				examples from this book and the very early internet art pieces seem really simple.  I know of some websites 
				that have more complexity than the art examples listed in the book.  I think art is something that can be 
				non&ndash;static and can incorporate changing pieces, but it should not be treated as traditional art becasue 
				eventually it will have an expiration date.</p>
				<h3>Requirements</h3>
				<p>From cave paintings to epic cathedral art to modern internet art, the medium through which artwork 
				is displayed is one of the major factors in that artworks ability to speak out and convey its message, 
				theme, or idea. As you read chapter 2, consider the medium of the internet and how artwork displayed 
				on the web is treated, viewed, and expressed. Within 100-150 words, discuss the internet as a medium 
				for artistic expression and display as well as both the benefits it offers and the disadvantages it 
				may have. Compair internet art vs. traditional art found in museums.</p>

				<h1>Reading 4: Internet Art - Chapter 3</h1>
				<p>I found the different facets of Ars Electronica interesting, especially the tension between the hacking 
				and artist groups.  It was clear that they both had different objectives, but because they were represented 
				by the same group, the threats of the one group translated and affected the other pretty severely.  I think 
				the idea of tactical media is one of the founding principles of the internet and we see these ideals 
				represented in today's world.  The internet is a free place where anyone can find their voice.  People are 
				becoming the subjects rather than the objects of modernity.  Everyone involved in this effort, no matter how 
				they represent themselves can stand behind the common ideals of action and impact.</p>

				<h3>Requirements</h3>
				<p>Many of the pieces discussed in this weeks reading engage the viewer in the work and idea. Through 
				this interaction and collaboration the theme and context of the piece arises. Within 100-150 words, 
				discuss one example from this weeks reading and how the community and user interactions with it are 
				able to bring about the message, theme, and context of the piece.</p>

				<h1>Reading 5</h1>
				<p>I thought Adrian Miles's VLOG site very similar in what some YouTubers are trying to do with the site 
				now.  I thought it was interesting that the term Vlog was around as far back as 2002, back when few people 
				even had an idea of what blogging was.  Though the videos I see today are nowhere near Miles's vision of 
				linked desktops and layered videos, I see vloggers trying to create more interactive videos every year.  
				Though this might seem like a step back from Miles's vision, YouTube is mass producing a small portion 
				of Miles's vision and making it freely available to anyone, not just someone with the software/hardware 
				to produce these videos.</p>
				<h3>Requirements</h3>
				<p>The art pieces within this final chapter focus on works reliant on digital networks in order to be 
				conveyed properly within the vision of the artist. While many of these pieces are several years old and 
				either utilized custom networks or now deprecated networks, with the recent emergence of web 2.0 
				technologies, the delivery methods for such projects have only expanded. Choose a specific example from 
				chapter 4 and discuss how this piece could be re-implemented within today's web 2.0 environment and still 
				convey the same topic or theme as was originally intended. How would the project change (for better or 
				for worse) existing within a new networked environment?</p>
