				<h1>Creative Brief</h1>
				
				<p>I have always been extremely interested in interface design and usability.  In CS, I'm studying 
				Human-Centered-Computing and I have spent a lot of time researching what goes into good design.  
				It seems that there is an intuitive element that goes into good design that makes it feel like 
				someone has to be born with.  In my thesis project, I want to analyze different websites and really 
				study what goes into making them.  I want to see of there is a formula for good design.  </p>
				
				<p>I heard once that Google spend hundreds of thousands of dollars researching the exact color of blue 
				that their links should be when they gave search results, to optimize how often users would actually 
				click on them.  Facebook blue is almost instantly recognizable and besides black and white it the 
				only color the site uses.   Blue, it seams, is the color of the Internet and the choices websites as 
				large as Facebook and Google would not make these choices lightly.</p>
				
				<p>Site layout is something that is designers spend tons of time trying to perfect, so I wonder if 
				there is a sort of golden ratio to create the best website.  Is there a common padding and margin size 
				that makes text more readable?  Is horizontal navigation always the best?  Do sites have the same 
				functionality for active, hovering, or visited links?  Is there a standard, or does it depend on the 
				website?</p>
				
				<p>This project will be web-based and will be displayed with the other web-based thesis projects.   
				For the project, I plan to display each of these websites as a common user sees them and once they 
				click around of hover over parts, the div size, padding, margin will be displayed, showing the 
				behind-the-scenes of what goes into the website.  At the end of the demos, I would like to create 
				the average or common denominator website that employs the commonalities between all the sites I 
				displayed before.</p>

				<h3>Requirements</h3>
				
				<p>Write a 1 page, double&ndash;spaced, creative brief for your TAM Thesis Project 
				
				<p>Your creative brief should 
				describe the creative interpretation of the project, the technical approach you plan on taking, 
				the inspirations and conceptual background of the piece, and desired presentation location within 
				the ATLAS building</p>

				<h1>Rough Cut</h1>
				
				<p>Right now I have three (four) pages built for my project.  I'm thinking of heading into a 
				CSS Zen garden direction, with a common webpage and applying different css to each of the pages for
				different websites.  I'm goin to do Google, Facebook, YouTube, Yahoo, MSN, Blogger, Twitter, 
				Wikipedia, and Windows Live.  They each took a little longer to dsplay than I anticipated, so I only
				have three pages done now, but will complete more.  </p>
				
				<p>I'm still unsure about how I want to display each page, I want to have the complete page display
				becasue I want the full effect of the page, but it makes displaying them difficult.  I've been looking
				into creating a greater webpage with a slide show of each of the pages, and a user will click to open
				a lightbox with each page in it.  The slide show at the beginning will have a description of the page
				and a grid layout for the page, or a breakdown of the styling.</p>
				
				<p>I'm still playing around with the idea of creating the 'best' webpage, with all of the elements 
				averaged out, but maybe creating a 'build your webpage' option, where someone could input their own 
				text and content for each of the sections and pick which styling from each page they want.</p>

				<h3>Requirements</h3>
				
				<p>Continue building your thesis project and begin moving towards a rough cut</p>
				
				<p>Your rough cut should be a working draft of your project but may still need 
				moderate amounts of content, details, and structure before being considered completed.  
				Your rough cut is not to be interpreted as a final completed piece.  Rough cuts 
				of your projects will be critiqued by your peers and the instructor</p>
				
				<p>Be prepared to present on the rough cut due date</p>

				<h1>Project Description</h1>
				
				<p>Popular Styling</p>
				
				<p>Brittany Kos</p>
				
				<p>According to Alexa.com, the top visited websites in America are 
				Google, Facebook, YouTube, Yahoo, Wikipedia, Twitter, and Amazon.  
				Each of these sites has millions of hits daily and the color scheme 
				and layout can be recognized instantly.  This project focuses on the 
				styling for these nine of the top America websites.  It duplicates the 
				look of each site and applies it to a common page.  </p>
				
				<p>Each of these sites has development teams of hundreds or thousands of 
				people working behind the scenes, to create a unique user experience for 
				its visitors.  The content being displayed and the user's needs drive the 
				design for each site and are continually being updates.  </p>
				
				<p>The idea behind the project is to apply the most recognizable styling 
				techniques each of these sites use to a standard webpage and see how well 
				each site's styling transfers.  In this interactive project, a user, one 
				can apply an entire site's styling to the webpage, or pick and choose 
				elements from each site.   This is supposed to be a thought experiment to 
				explore how well website design can be abstracted, adapted, and applied 
				outside of its common usage.</p>

				<h3>Requirements</h3>
				
				<p>Compose a text document which includes the following info regarding your TAM 
				Thesis Project: Your name, major, and the title of your thesis work.  A brief, 150 
				- 200 word description of your your project. </p>
				
				<p>Do not simply copy/paste your original creative brief. Your description should 
				be what your thesis IS not what you plan it to be.</p>
				
				<p>The instructor will print and include your description, next to your project, 
				after you install your thesis work within the ATLAS building.  Upload your descriptions 
				in either .html or .doc format.</p>

				<h3>Requirements</h3>
				
				<p>Utilizing the fundamentals and principles you have learned throughout your 
				time in the TAM program, create a senior quality thesis project</p>
				
				<p>The subject matter and theme for your thesis project are up to you but should 
				be academic in nature and demonstrate a critical understanding of technology, arts, and media.
				
				<p>A combination of TAM and your major is recommended as your conceptual starting point 
				for your project but you may ultimately choose a topic outside of your major so long as 
				it is academic in nature, and focused on some topic within technology, arts and media.  Your 
				project can be in any medium. </p>
				
				<p>Your thesis project needs to be installed within the ATLAS building. Consider the 
				context of you piece and how best it could be displayed and viewed by your audience.  The 
				topic, medium and presentation location of your Thesis Project must be approved by the instructor</p>
				
				<p>This is your final culminating project as a TAM student. This piece should be taken 
				very seriously and, in turn, should be appropriate in scope to match a level of senior quality work</p>
