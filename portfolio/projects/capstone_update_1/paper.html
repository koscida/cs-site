				<h3>Requirements</h3>
				
				<p>Write a research paper on a person, group of people, organization or company who is exploring 
				the intersection of Technology, Arts, and Media and your major field of study.  Your paper should 
				be between 4-5 pages in length (Double-spaced).</p>
				
				<p>Your paper must include at least 3 cited sources listed within a bibliography.  Citations must 
				be from legitimate sources which include published books, documentary, media, journals, interviews, 
				primary source websites, etc.  Wikipedia, Google, and third party blogs are not legitimate sources 
				and should only be used to help you find more factual resources for you paper.</p>
				
				<p>This paper is due posted to your portal in .doc format.  While not required, rough drafts and 
				outlines turned in by WED NOV 2nd will be reviewed by the instructor for comments and feedback.</p>
				
				<p>Because of the open-ended topic and the major-specific nature of this paper, it is 
				recommended that you establish your subject matter early on. The Capstone instructor might be 
				able to help to find a topic, but you are more knowledgeable about your own major and thus you, 
				and perhaps your major professors, will be better able to come up with a topic relative to the 
				assignment</p>
