		<h1>CSCI 3112</h1>
		<p>This is the intro page for CSCI 3112 Spring 2011.  This semester I focused on learning scripting languages (though a majority of it was tutorials and basics) and developing my human network.  I've talked a lot with coworkers and professionals in the field about what kind of jobs are available and where.  My goal is to stay in Colorado, specifically in the Southern-Denver area.  This has limied my intern selection a lot, but it have been interesting to learn about other oppertunities else where.</p>
		<p>The programming aspect has been in Javascript, jQuery, AJAX, JSON, and any other web scripeing language with a J in it. This has been challenging, but productive and extremely useful as I delv into more advanced web development.  Part of my semester has also been devoted to starting to develop web sites for groups I know.</p>
