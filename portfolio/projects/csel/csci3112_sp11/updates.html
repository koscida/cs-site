		<h2>.: Week 16(15) ~ Apr 25 :.</h2>
		<p><b>What I did: </b>I looked at some website, trying to get more ideas for the two sites I'm working on for the tanning salon and the youth group. I'm in this development rut now and would like some fresh ideas. </p>
		<p><b>What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network: </b> I talked more with Leysia and Katie about doing research, possibly for a Senior Thesis instead of Senior Projects. I asked what went into both and how they provided different things. I really need to decide whether I want to do a Masters or PhD. I asked what kind of opportunities came from both. Since I want to go into industry, a Masters would be better, but if I wanted to do Research, a PhD would be best. I would really like to R&D, but the idea of Consulting also came up. My job at ASIT hired another temp developer, so I went out to lunch with him one day and we talked about he different consulting jobs available in Boulder. After talking with him, I don't know if consulting is right for me. </p>
		<p><b>How long I spent: </b>1 hour looking at other websites<br/>30 minutes talking to Katie <br/>1 hour at lunch with my co-worker </p>
		<p><b>What I plan to do next week: </b>Finish what I can on my website, look into professor's research to see if a Senior thesis would be good, and do my final presentation.</p>

		<h2>.: Week 15(14) ~ Apr 18 :.</h2>
		<p><b>What I did: </b>I redid some of my updates, didn't realize my dates were off from the template and I was actually behind in updating.  That's fixed (now that I only have one more update to go, go figure) and I'm making headway on the rest of my site.  I was talking with some other TAM students who had internships lined up this summer and I asked what kind of resume/cover letters got them interviews and positions.  One thing I took away was a portfolio of work. I have been working on this in a round about way with my sites, but I feel like they have just been updates of my work and not really showcasing my work.  I looked at the TAM Portals of the students and had some ideas on how to organize the work I have been doing.  I'm working on reworking the navigation for my CSEL site and showcasing some projects I have worked on this and previous semesters.  </p>
		<p><b>What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network: </b>Like I previously mentioned, I talked with some TAM students in my DM2 class about their internship experience and what they would recommend when job hunting.  No one really had good advice about writing cover letters, except to tailor write specific resumes and letters to each of the companies I would be applying for.  The interviews were also interesting, since must of the students did not come from technical backgrounds and had behavioral interviews only.  The type of questions asked in those interviews seemed similar to other behavioral interviews I have had in the past, though.</p>
		<p><b>How long I spent: </b>1 hour talking with other students and 1-2 hours working on my site.</p>
		<p><b>What I plan to do next week: </b>One of my classes is ending and I have an opportunity to work on my resume and cover letter with my professors.  I will participate in any of the workshops she holds for her students.</p>

		<h2>.: Week 14(13) ~ Apr 11 :.</h2>
		<p><b>What I did: </b>I decided to look more into the Master's degree that CU offers for Computer Science.  I am planning on entering grad school right after I obtain by BS and am still undecided on the Thesis vs Non-Thesis option and I researched it this week.<br/>
I talked with Leysia Palen about the possibility of doing research in her lab for my Masters thesis.  She is an HCC professor here and works on project EPIC, which deals with crisis informatics research.  She recommended to me that if I wanted to do a research thesis, I should test out research first and either do the Senior Research Track for my BS Capstone or do an independent study in her lab next year.  This would introduce me doing research in general and give me a head start for my MS.  She recommended that I read some of the papers her lab has turned out to get an idea of the type of research they are doing to see if I am interested in that specific field.</p>
		<p><b>What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network: </b>See above.</p>
		<p><b>How long I spent: </b>1 hour talking with Leysia and 2-3 hours reading the papers her lab produced.</p>
		<p><b>What I plan to do next week: </b>Finish up some of the web projects I have been working on and begin planning for the final presentation. </p>

		<h2>.: Week 13(12) ~ Apr 4 :.</h2>
		<p><b>What I did: </b> I worked on the website for the my church youth group. My sister is the one who introduced me to the idea. Currently, it is a different situation, since the website in place now if functioning and they are relatively pleased with it. The new site I am making is just an updated version, bit I am doing it without requirements. The plan is to mock up a prototype and present it to them to see if they like the design and then fully complete it. </p>
		<p><b>What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network: industry night</b> I talked with my professor ( the same one from last week with the the potential internship). Though the job was not something that I thought would work out, it was good keeping up with that contact, especially since she will be teaching again next semester and might need her as a resource for grad school.
There was also a Faculty Mixer in that the BOLD center hosted last Wednesday. I went for a little bit after I got out of work. I'm glad that I wasn't there for too long, since the event was not organized that well and students ended up talking to students and there were less faculty members than I thought there would be. The most interesting part was talking to professors about their research and projects they were working on. Since I ended up talking with other professors from other departments, it was cool to see what went on outside of Computer Science. </p>
		<p><b>How long I spent: </b>I spent 4-5 hours planning the website for my youth group; an hour or so emailing my professor back and forth; and less than an hour at the mixer. </p>
		<p><b>What I plan to do next week: </b>I would like to talk with Leysia Palen about working in her lab, possibly for a senior thesis next year and maybe grad school. </p>

		<h2>.: Week 12(11) ~ Mar 28 :.</h2>
		<p><b>What I did: </b>I finally got my site done.  I've updates a few things and started uploading everything I've been working on this semester here. </p>
		<p><b>What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network: </b>A professor last semester email me about an intern opertunity her job had opening, so I emailed her back and asked a few questions about the position and what kind of work I would be doing.  Though I have part of my summer scoped out, this could be an additional possibility for the summer.</p>
		<p><b>How long I spent: </b>3 hours on the site and 1 hour talking to my contact.</p>
		<p><b>What I plan to do next week: </b>So with my multiple TAM classes and two semesters of HCCPD, I've accumulated four seperate sites that I would like to standarize and make more corherent. Right now they are all over the place, broken, unorgnized, and conufsing; with the focus on web presence in this class, a goal of mine would be to clean them up.</p>

		<h2>.: Week 11 ~ Mar 21 :.</h2>
		<p><b>Spring Break!</b></p>
	</div>
	
	
	<div class="grid_10 color center round">
		<h2>.: Week 10 ~ Mar 14 :.</h2>
		<p><b>What I did: </b>I talked more with some of the start-ups I met at Start-Up to students.  Specifically Mapleton Hill, they seem like an interesting company with a great development model. Their training and introduction of new people into the company seem welcoming and an environment I would like to work in. I do have some reservations about working with a start-up, especially one so small, however their client turnover rate appeared strong and solid, which is always a benefit.</p>
		<p><b>What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network: </b>See above.</p>
		<p><b>How long I spent: </b>2-3 hours</p>
		<p><b>What I plan to do next week: </b>Enjoy my spring break.</p>
	</div>
	
	
	<div class="grid_10 color center round">
		<h2>.: Week 9 ~ Mar 7 :.</h2>
		<p><b>What I did: </b>Lots and lots of career events. On Wednesday there was the TAM Networking Event, which was interesting. There was too many students to companies and I felt the event was much larger than they anticipated. It was difficult getting one-on-one time with any representative and I ended up talking to more students than reps.
On Thursday was a Lockheed Martin rep come and talk to SWE, so I went. Though this was not a career event perhaps, it did give me more information about the company and was more of a personal perspective instead of the usual promotion they do at the career fair or the large events they do for engineering.
On Friday was Start-Up-To-Students, which was really cool and Ben did an awesome job setting it up. Everyone there was looking for web developers, especially Ruby on Rails developers. There are a few start-ups I am going to apply for internships to and I would really like experience working at, if only for one semester. This networking event was so different from TAM one, it was much larger with a better turn out on both the student and employee parts. Plus think there were more positions being offered than there were students present, which was a surprise seeing how the companies were small start-ups. </p>
		<p><b>What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network: </b>See above</p>
		<p><b>How long I spent: </b>Wednesday: 1.5 hours<br/>
Thursday: 1.5 hours<br/>
Friday: 2.5 hours <br/></p>
		<p><b>What I plan to do next week: </b>Programming, work on my website, maybe a few Ruby on Rails tutorials. Its spring break, I really want to get everything on my site polished. </p>

		<h2>.: Week 8 ~ Feb 28 :.</h2>
		<p><b>What I did: </b>My job is going agile. Because of this, we had scrum training. Though this was offered through my job, it was optional for me as a student, but I decided to go anyway. We sat through an a half explanation of what it means for a team to be agile and how that makes us function as a team. I found this useful, especially since I'm heading of more companies around here becoming agile and using this technique to organize their software development. And though it wasn't much, I went through an AJAX tutorial.</p>
		<p><b>What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network: </b>I didn't actively do much in this area this week, because I am preparing for the two career events next week: Start-Up-To-Students and the TAM Networking Event.  I've updated my resume based on how recruiters responded to it at the Career Fair.  For example, one wanted more of a focus on my OO experience, and another wanted links to projects I have done.  I have also been practicing my 'elevator speech' and watching videos on the career services website about networking.</p>
		<p><b>How long I spent: </b>1 hour in Scrum Training, 1 hour on the AJAX Tutorial, and 2 hours working on my resume and watching videos.</p>
		<p><b>What I plan to do next week: </b>I need to update my website again.  I will go to the TAM Networking Event on Wednesday, and Start-Up-To-Students on Friday. </p>
	</div>
	
	
	
	<div class="grid_10 color center round">
		<h2>.: Week 7 ~ Feb 21 :.</h2>
		<p><b>What I did: </b>Applied for a few internships.  Though I am planning on staying on Boulder this summer and taking classes and working, I thought it would be good to build interview experience and to get my name out there.  It was helpful going to the career fair these past years and talking with recruiters becuse over the years, they have remembered me and I have received more response with persistance.</p>
		<p><b>What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network: </b>Spent a long time at the CSO website and reworking my resume.  I also wrote a few cover letters for specific jobs.  I have a working template I build last year that I keep woking off of, but I have learned it is always better to tailor the cover letter the the specific position or company I'm applying for, so it doesn't look so contrived.</p>
		<p><b>How long I spent: </b>3-4 hours</p>
		<p><b>What I plan to do next week: </b>More coding.  I really need to transfer my examples over to this website.  I wonder if the CSEL server has PHP installed, I could transfer some examples over here too.</p>
	</div>
	
	
	<div class="grid_10 color center round">
		<h2>.: Week 6 Update ~ Feb 14 :.</h2>
		<p><b>What I did:</b> Looked through some jQuery libraries, most on tables and forms. I worked a lot with them in the website I'm working on at my job, so I tried to duplicate their functionality on my own. <a href="week6.html"> Week 6 Examples </a></p>
		<p><b>What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network:</b> Talked with a programming contracting company rep for a bit. He was the one who hired the two guys at my job, so he works a lot on Boulder and knows the contracting market pretty good.</p>
		<p><b>How long I spent:</b> 2-3 hours playing with jQuery. </p>
		<p><b>What I plan to do next week:</b> Get a site working that will show each week what I have been doing with Javascript/jQuery/Ajax </p>
	</div>
	
	
	<div class="grid_10 color center round">
		<h2>.: Week 5 Update ~ Feb 7 :.</h2>
		<p><b>What I did:</b> Went through some jQuery tutorials online. <a href="week5.html">Week 5 Examples</a></p>
		<p><b>What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network:</b> I went on for an interview at Fast. I have interviewed with them before and it was good experience to interview again, even if I do not want an interview with them this time. </p>
		<p><b>How long I spent:</b> 1.5 hours going through tutorials, and the Fast interview was an hour long. </p>
		<p><b>What I plan to do next week:</b> Work more with jQuery and I don't really have a plan for professional plans </p>
	</div>

	
	<div class="grid_10 color center round">
		<h2>.: Week 4 Update ~ Jan 31 :.</h2>
		<p><b>What I did: </b>Fought with the permissions of my website. CSEL kept saying that my access to my directories was denies because of permissions issues. It turns out that the new directories I created were on a Mac and the files within them were on a PC. I don't know why this caused problems, but I only had to recreate the directories on a PC.</p>
		<p><b>What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network: </b>I went to the career fair.</p>
		<p><b>How long I spent: </b>2 hours fighting with my website, and a total of 4 hours at the career fair between the two days.</p>
		<p><b>What I plan to do next week: </b>Work on developing my contacts. </p>
	</div>


	<div class="grid_10 color center round">
		<h2>.: Week 3 Update ~ Jan 24 :.</h2>
		<p><b>What I did: </b>This week I focused a lot on JavaScript and integrating some javascript changes into my webpages.  I lot of information I found just by googling the web for answers. I found out the last time I took this class that having a project to work on was the best way to learn code.  Having a goal in mind and being able to achieve it helps with learning different ways to do things. <a href="week3.html">Week 3 Example</a></p>
		<p><b>What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network: </b>I talked more with my co-worker about what web technologies he thought useful and what he had encountered the most in his career. He gave me some websites where he found useful links and information and code.</p>
		<p><b>How long I spent: </b>I spent around 3-4 hours working on javascript, just writing code and bug fixing.  I then spent an additional 2 hours or so talking with my co-worker.</p>
		<p><b>What I plan to do next week: </b>I would like to finish my work with javascript. I am currently trying to redo my navigation bar to run off javascript and not just html/css. I would like to implement a drop down menu for the navigation for next week's project.</p>

		<h2>.: Week 2 Update ~ Jan 17 :.</h2>
		<p><b>What I did: </b>"develop my professional awareness"</p>
		<p><b>What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network: </b>I talked with a contracted developer at my job to see what kinds of jobs he has worked on in the past and what languages and skills he thinks would be most useful in learning.</p>
		<p><b>How long I spent: </b>3 hours</p>
		<p><b>What I plan to do next week: </b>Start work on practicing coding.</p>
