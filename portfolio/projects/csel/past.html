			<h3><a href="http://redwood.colorado.edu/coerh/dm2/home.php">Hotspots</a></h3>
			<p>Hotspots is a webpage built as a roadtrip planner and vacation spot finder.  Different 'Hotspots' around the Western US are prefilled.  And the site is fully functioning right now.</p>
			<p>This was a team project from a previous class.  It is written in PHP, and I am adapting the project to fit within a framework.  I am also adding additional functionality from the original site.  The functional specs can be found at the class website <a href="http://redwood.colorado.edu/kosba/dm2/teamproject.html">Here. </a></p>

			<h3><a href="#">21st Century Photobooth</a></h3>
			<p>This was a project I did for CSCI 4839: User Centered Design.  The 21st century Photo Booth is a reimagining of the original photo booths commonly seen in malls and tourist attractions.  The goal was to create a common place for people to share their culture, thoughts, and experiences.  A physical photo booth was constructed with a computer interface to record, and track videos.  Future work would have included creating a website to host and share the videos, so people could share and search the videos. </p>
			<p>I worked in a team of 5 for this project and was in charge of helping with the creative and building the physical photo booth.  We conducted three separate user study sessions and completed four iterations before the end of the semester.  </p>

			<h3><a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/department/news/spring2009expo.html">Magic Mailbox</a></h3>
			<p>The Magic Mailbox was a project I did for my Freshmen Projects class.  It physically was an oversized mailbox short enough for 4-6 year old children to reach inside.  It would take pictures of whatever was inside the mailbox and email them to 'parents'.</p>
			<p>The team consisted of 10 freshmen engineering students.  I was responsible for managing the software group, as well as being head programmer.  Specifically I developed the UI, and created the two environments the application ran in.  I also helped with user testing and application demo.</p>
