		<h2>.: Week 5 :: Covering Sept 12 :.</h2>
		<p><b>What I did:</b>
		For another one of my classes, we are thinking about starting a game start-up, so keeping all creative rights for 
		our game ideas is important.  We needed to get our forum off Facebook, and I volunteered to make a website.  Instead 
		of creating a Google group, or Google site, I thought it would be good practice to make the website from scratch, 
		which looking back was a lot more work than I anticipated.<br/>
		The link to the website is <a href="redwood.colorado.edu/kosba/gameDev">here</a>, and there is a guest login with the 
		username 'Guest' and password as 'password'.  Some of the main functionality the site has now is a working forum, notes, 
		and deliverables.  I plan on expending on it throughout the semester, and will be posting updates to it here.  Though 
		this week's work did diverge from last week's plan, it was needed and was a great refresher to SQL.  I spent quite a 
		lot of time on the database, making sure everything was keyed correctly, and even optimized each of the fields, making 
		sure I used the correct data types and allocated enough space for them.
		</p>
		<p><b>What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network:</b>
		I am preparing some more for the career fair, so I went to a resume critique on campus.  This one was not geared 
		towards engineering (or computer science) students, so some of the information was a little unhelpful and generic.  
		However, it was good to go and listen to industry representatives talk about what they see in a resume.
		</p>
		<p><b>How long I spent:</b>
		20+ hours on the website, seriously, for as little as this website looks, it took me forever<br/>
		2 hours going to the resume panel and working on my resume some more
		</p>
		<p><b>What I plan to do next week:</b>
		My database book finally came, so I plan on reading some chapters in it and looking into different implementations of 
		databases<br/>
		Since I already have the website working for my group, I also would like to look more into Google Spreadsheets for the 
		back end database for it.  I think it is a project that have some interesting potential.
		</p>
	</div>

	
	<div class="grid_10 color center round">
		<h2>.: Week 4 :: Covering Sept 5 :.</h2>
		<p><b>What I did: </b>
		I've started looking into non-traditional databases online, my main interest being in Google Spreadsheets.  Though I 
		haven't looked at the size limitations Google Docs has regarding the amount of information one is able to keep in a 
		spreadsheet for free, it does seem like a useful resource for small web projects.  I set up an example 
		<a href="http://csel.cs.colorado.edu/~kosba/csci3112_fa11/examples.html">here</a> to show some of the work I've been 
		doing.  Google Spreadsheets seems like a great resource and possible database for sites that need a database backing 
		it, but don't have SQL.<br/>
		I mostly looked <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/spreadsheets/data/3.0/developers_guide.html#ListingSpreadsheets">
		here</a> for the Spreadsheet API and <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/spreadsheets/data/3.0/reference.html#CellFeed">
		here</a> for better specific examples.  <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/samples/spreadsheet_sample.html">
		This</a> page was extremely helpful in looking at the receiving JSON objects.
		</p>
		<p><b>What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network: </b>
		I looked through the Career Services website and the upcoming events and I've registered for a few things coming up 
		before the career fair.
		</p>
		<p><b>How long I spent: </b>
		1 hour reading the Google documentation<br/>
		4+ messing with JSON trying to get the correct cell in a spreadsheet feed going to the webpage.<br/>
		2+ hour changing the webpage so spreadsheet displayed differently <br/>
		1 hour on the career services website
		</p>
		<p><b>What I plan to do next week: </b>
		I hope my database book arrive, since I had trouble ordering it online, I would like to start reading it soon.  I also 
		want to continue web based projects, at least for another week, looking into other web based database resources.

		<h2>.: Week 3 :: Covering Aug 29 :.</h2>
		<p><b>What I did: </b>
		I went through my graduation requirements and the cs course page again, realizing with sinking hope, that 7 of the possible 
		9 Track Foundation classes will not be offered before Spring 2012, and I have no way of graduating without repeating a course 
		or substituting one. So, I re-registered for this class, this time taking 3 credits in hope it will be approved as a 
		replacement for the Databases course. I spent some time researching different database types on the internet as well as looking 
		into what new developments are happening in the field. I've looked at this semester's Database course webpage and have been 
		following through with the slides posted. I also bought the book associated with that course and will be reading through it 
		over the semester. All of this is in preparation for the semester plan I have to turn into Lesley to get approved for the course 
		substitution.
		</p>
		<p><b>What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network: </b>
		Not much, I broke out the old code for my portfolio webpage, looked it over, and updated it, in anticipation of using it this 
		semester when looking for an internship.
		</p>
		<p><b>How long I spent: </b>
		Quite some time emailing Lesley and pleading with her to approve the increase in credit hours so I can graduate on time
		I spent an hour or so researching and reading about databases on the web 
		An hour reading through Buzz's Database Website
		And another hour on code for my website
		</p>
		<p><b>What I plan to do next week: </b>
		I plan to have the course plan done by then, so I will be following through that schedule. I want to read chapters 1 and 2 of 
		the Database book and hopefully set up a host environment on my PC so I can actually use different databases first hand. I will 
		also look over Buzz's website and see if he has posted homework and try to follow along.

		<h2>.: Week 2 :: Covering Aug 22 :.</h2>
		<p><b>What I did: </b>
		I wasn't enrolled in the class yet, but I did decide that week to add the class in hope of fulfilling the Database course I 
		cannot take because of the conflict with Senior Projects.
		</p>
		<p><b>What I did to develop my professional awareness and/or my human network: </b>
		Nothing, I wasn't in the class yet.
		</p>
		<p><b>How long I spent: </b>
		Few minutes emailing Lesley
		</p>
		<p><b>What I plan to do next week: </b>
		Think of ideas of what to do the the rest of the semester. What I would like to study from Databases, different schemas I could 
		study. Clayton gave me a few good leads I might follow.

		<h2>.: Week 1 :: Pre Class :.</h2>
		<p><b>Brief biographical sketch: </b>
		Hello, my name is Brittany, I'm a 4th year Computer Science and TAM student, and I'm hoping to graduate in Dec 2012 with a 
		Masters degree also. I'm in the HCC track and interested in GUIs and UCD.  I spend my time doing homework, taking 19 credit 
		hours, working at ASIT, and volunteering. <br/>
		I do not spend my time sleeping.
		</p>
		<p><b>Brief statement of purpose: </b>
		I would like to become a usability engineer after I graduate and spend time working with clients developing interfaces.
		</p>
		<p><b>Plan for what you intend to do in this class this semester: </b>
		*Insert plan here*<br/>
		**This might have something to do with databases, game dev, and networking for an internship**
